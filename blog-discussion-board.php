			I just read some of <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6808" alt="NASA article" target="_blank">this</a> article from the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov" alt="NASA JPL" target="_blank">NASA JPL</a>
			web page on what's called the 22 visionary exploration concepts. This is what ASTER strives for; the research and development of advancements in technology and science. Our way of going about it is much different compared to NASA's JPL though. Our team
			is a group of visionaries who offer their time and efforts to the causes we all care for in advancements in science, engineering, medical, agricultural and a multitude of other areas through collaboration of peoples of all
			varying backgrounds. A full spectrum of people with unique backgrounds, some similar to those at NASA, many who have very different skills, knowledge and assets to share and give to our cause. People like you reading this
			blog right now. Anyone willing to contribute to something far greater than themselves is welcome. ASTER is an attempt at starting a point of origin for us all with similar interests, no matter your background, to form together
			and collaborate, share, discuss, teach, show, inspire, and push each other to the greater limits. A community of like-minds who work together to think of the big ideas and lead each other to a greater future for humankind.

			The following here has also been displayed on our <a href="aerospace.html#ULA">Aerospace</a> section as well. I saw this quote shared in a <a href="aerospace.html#ULA">video</a> by the United Launch Alliance and felt inspired by its words.
			<b>"We set sail on this new sea because their is knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they may be won and used for the progress of all people."</b> - JFK, 1962
		</p>
		
		<p id="paragraph">
			Keeping in mind this quote made by John F. Kennedy in 1962, we of ASTER feel that with the participation of anyone whose ideals and ambitions similar to that of ASTER have the potential
			to once again spark a new generation of dreamers and ambitious minds to help us create the reality of us being a space faring people.
		</p>
		
		<p id="paragraph">
			With the gathering of a great multitude of individuals here at ASTER anything is possible and can be achieved. With an amalgamation of unique skills, knowledge and resources from
			each of you who become a part of the community, the team of ASTER, we can begin to form a collective mind that will evolve, develop and continue to grow into an unstoppable force
			of people who will take us closer to the goals of giving access to such great technological advancements to all humanity.
		</p>
		
		<p id="paragraph" class="log">
			We are an "open-source" collaborative group providing a place for everyone to come share their ideas, their own individual developments and research with our collective group from
			around the world; working with each other, seeking advice and answers to areas of science, engineering, technology and a vast selection of other fields to grow us all into a productive and
			more advanced society. ASTER is meant for research and development amongst peers, being forth coming, transparent, and having full disclosure of our ideas, research, developments, and advancements
			along with yours. We at ASTER feel that true technological advancement comes from the involvment and collaboration of us all, not select individuals, so please join us as we continue to
			strive for the advancements of <b>A</b>erospace, <b>S</b>cience, <b>T</b>echnology, <b>E</b>nergy, <b>R</b>obotics and so much more.

			I just saw a video shared by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory named
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNASAJPL%2Fvideos%2F10154630585623924%2F&show_text=0&width=560" target="_blank" alt="Cassini"><b>"NASA's Cassini Mission to Saturn"</b></a>.
			I've shared this video and the following comments under the <a href="science.html#Cassini" alt="Science section">Science</a> section as well.
		</p>
		
		<p id="paragraph">
			Cassini, a truly inspirational journey. Projects like NASA's Cassini mission to Saturn has inspired us over the life of NASA's history. Over the past many years though, it seems there has been slow
			progression to do more for our advancements in space flight and human space travel due to several reasons and obstacles that a federally funded agency like NASA has had to endure.
			The recent years of private funded corporations partaking in the space industry, such as Space-X and Virgin Galactic, the two most well-known private companies has tried to do their part
			to help continue to inspire human space exploration and space flight by performing their own projects.
		</p>
		
		<p id="paragraph">
			We here at ASTER also have this passion to ignite the human desire for space travel and exploration and we feel
			that we offer to do so in our own unique way compared to government agencies or private corporations. ASTER is designed to have not just the privileged few who, through their own
			hard work and dedication, have earned their right to be a part of those entities, but we also seek and indeed encourage the cooperation of anyone who wants to contribute their ideas
			and work to the entire ASTER community. Our goal is to have everyone who can contribute do so and do so often. ASTER is intended for a collaboration of like-minded peoples on matters of
			the acronym of ASTER and many other fields and to provide a location for the people to come to for the opportunity to collaborate, to innovate, inspire, share and
			possibly proceed on to developments into areas like aerospace and space science. Collaborative public research and development to create new innovations and inspire current and future generations.
			A collective community helping each other reach for the stars and beyond.

			I came across this video today of a gentleman who spoke truth on issues that most, if not all of us face within our lives. Insecurity and confidence. Insecurity comes easy and confidence not so easy.
			With one or the lack of the other they can destroy a person's self worth and dreams if not properly dealt with.
		</p>
		
		<p id="paragraph">
			When someone is secure, but lacks confidence, one is fearful and it becomes difficult to achieve the things one really desires to achieve. 
			When someone is confident, yet insecure, fear is usually at work again and their ambitions can possibly take them toward things that are potentially
			hazardous and self-destructive. What is obvious in words, sometimes isn't when faced in daily life, fear is almost always the culprit of any negative emotional characteristic.
			We can all fall victim to these tragedies, but when your spirit burns within to do something about it so that you may proceed on and conquer your goals,
			dreams, and ambitions the battle must be won from within, not from the outer world.
		</p>
		
		<p id="paragraph">
			We all want to achieve greatness, self-worth, leave a legacy behind, to feel important,
			and to obtain the sense of gratification and we can. We don't have to be alone and together we can achieve all that there is to be achieved when we do it together. Nothing is achieved
			by the individual alone. This is a great personal topic to us at ASTER. We are here for the purpose to have people like us with common goals and interests to help each other out for
			what we try to do because any of our successes is not possible without each of you.

			If you've never had the opportunity to watch Louis Rossmann on YouTube,
			this particular video he made is very informative and revealing. Here's the link to that video entitled: 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCcPA4HuRig" target="_blank" alt="Louis Rossmann video"><b>"A word on insecurity & confidence."</b></a>
			(Viewer discretion is advised.)

			I suppose the first discussion on here should be on what in tarnation is this place for? (This whole website you're on, of course).
			This is ASTER, an acronym that stands for Aerospace, Science, Technology, Energy, and Robotics. ASTER is really much more than
			what the acronym lists, but the name needed to be short, catchy, and memorable. Engineering, Medical, Agricultural, Industrial,
			Meteorological, and more science and engineering fields could be part of the name, but ASTEREMAIM would be too long and ridiculous. 
			Of course now that I notice we could have been called MASTER AIM, but I digress.
		</p>
		<p id="paragraph">
			ASTER is an attempt to somehow push our understanding of all science and engineering sections that are available (and possibly those yet to be discovered) farther, much farther than they are now.
			The want, the desire, the courage, the need to get our societal butts into gear and actually achieve what we've all wanted to see and make happen for
			decades, but for whatever the reasons haven't. To do the things no one else will. ASTER is an infant right now, and "her" plans are in the infant
			stages, but we're hoping to guide "her", to nudge "her" into a position that is going to go far beyond the skies, because here the sky is not the limit,
			there is so much more, and we want to take you all along for the journey. Stay tuned friends!
